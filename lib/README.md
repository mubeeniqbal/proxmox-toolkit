# Shared Bash Library

This directory contains reusable Bash library modules intended to support shell scripting across Linux environments. These utilities are not limited to automation workflowsâ€”they can be used in any Bash script that benefits from standardized logging, error handling, and modular structure.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

The libraries in this directory are designed to:

* Standardize logging across all scripts.
* Provide safe and consistent error and signal trapping.
* Offer reusable, tested, and composable shell utilities.
* Enforce fail-fast, production-safe scripting practices.
* Validate script prerequisites (e.g., root access, command existence)

## ðŸ“¦ Library Modules

| File             | Purpose                                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `log.sh`         | Unified logging for stdout and syslog                                             |
| `traps.sh`       | Signal and error trapping for safe script teardown                                |
| `shell_modes.sh` | Explicitly enables strict or debug mode per script                                |
| `assert.sh`      | Runtime assertions for files, directories, commands, and root user checks         |

All libraries are meant to be sourced, not executed directly.

## ðŸ§© Example Usage

### `log.sh`

```shell
readonly LOG_TAG="<tag_name>"
source /usr/local/lib/log.sh

log_info "Script started"
log_warn "Something might be off"
log_error "Something went wrong"
```

### `traps.sh`

```shell
readonly TRAP_TAG="<tag_name>"
source /usr/local/lib/traps.sh
# Automatically sets:
# trap 'catch_err $LINENO $?' ERR
# trap 'on_exit' EXIT INT TERM
```

### `shell_modes.sh`

```shell
source /usr/local/lib/shell_modes.sh
enable_strict_mode
```

## ðŸ›  Installation

To make these libraries globally available:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib
sudo cp *.sh /usr/local/lib/
sudo chmod 644 /usr/local/lib/*.sh
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/lib/*.sh
```

Make sure the containing directory is also readable:

```shell
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/lib
```

Then source them at the top of any script that needs them.

## ðŸ§± Philosophy

These libraries follow key design principles:

* ðŸ”’ Fail-fast and error-aware
* ðŸ§¼ Modular and composable
* ðŸ›¡ Defensive by default
* ðŸ§  Designed for general-purpose shell scripting
